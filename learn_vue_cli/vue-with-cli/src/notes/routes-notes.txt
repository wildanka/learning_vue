# Hash vs History.
try to open
https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_Utama_Inggris
there if you open the page, when you click on "Daftar Isi" / table of content. 
it will directing you to scroll to specific element on the page.
if we click Juara then the URL will be changed to https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_Utama_Inggris#Juara
and then the page will be scrolled.

thats how Hash work. so the Hash won't send any request to the server, but rather it lets the front-end handle out the request that using '#'

while if we use History. it's just a normal request that we ususally do. by using / it will call the server every time we called 
https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_Utama_Inggris
or 
https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_Utama_Inggris/Juara (only for example, if it exists)
to load the data.

at this moment personally, I'd think that Hash will be helpful when we create a Single Page Application (well just my hypotethic), but of course it should can be combined with history. lets find out later.
